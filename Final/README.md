# Django Voice Recorder - FFmpeg Fix

## Problem
The Django voice recorder application was showing the error: "FFmpeg not found. Install FFmpeg and ensure it is on PATH."

## Solution
The FFmpeg dependency has been resolved by:

1. **Installing imageio-ffmpeg**: This package provides a static FFmpeg binary that works across platforms
2. **Adding FFmpeg binary**: Copied the FFmpeg executable to `myproject/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg`
3. **PATH configuration**: Django settings automatically add the local FFmpeg directory to PATH

## Setup Instructions

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up FFmpeg binary:
   ```bash
   cd myproject
   mkdir -p ffmpeg/bin
   python3 -c "import imageio_ffmpeg; import shutil; shutil.copy2(imageio_ffmpeg.get_ffmpeg_exe(), 'ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg')"
   ```

3. Run the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. The voice transcription feature should now work without FFmpeg errors.

## What was Fixed

- **myproject/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg**: Added static FFmpeg binary (7.0.2)
- **requirements.txt**: Added necessary dependencies
- **Django settings**: Already configured to use local FFmpeg installation

## Verification

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python3 test_ffmpeg_fix.py
```

The application should now successfully:
- Detect FFmpeg in PATH
- Process audio files for transcription
- Work without "FFmpeg not found" errors
